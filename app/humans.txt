# Want To Help?

If you're interested in helping, please get in touch with me either
via email at devalchemist@pdxco.de or on twitter: @devalchemist. I
very well may end up needing some help with the PHP on things. I am 
only a beginner in PHP. The design, HTML, and CSS I have under control.
I am pretty decent with JavaScript and jQuery, but any pros out there
who want to help, I would love your expertise on this project. You can
never learn too many techniques for programming.

# THANKS

    Coming soon!

    HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
